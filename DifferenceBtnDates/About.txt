Problem:

1. Find the differnce between two dates without using inbuilt functions.
2. Input is of type String and date format is dd-mm-yyyy.
3. start and end date is inclusive.

Input: 
startDate: 06-02-2021
endDate: 12-03-2022

Output: 403 days

Solution:

1. if start year == end year
	1. if start year < end year, no of days can be calculated with the days between start month and end month.
	2. if start year < end year, no of days can be calculated with the difference between start month and end month.

2. else if start year < end year
	1. if start month > end month, one year is not completed. 
	2. No of days left between start month to dec month of the same year and No of days left between Jan month to end month of the next year is calculated.
	2. if start year - end year > 1, no of days between the years is calculated
		1. run a loop of year from startyear + 1 to less than end year
		2. if year is leap year, 366 days is added else 365 days is added.
	3. Finally no of days left in Start year, no of days between the years and no of days left in end year is added together to get the final year.
