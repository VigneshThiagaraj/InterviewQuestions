Numeric Problems:

ClassName: AddDecDigits
Problem: 
Given a number, increment the odd digits of the number & decrement the even digits of the number. Consider number ranges only from 0-9. So to decrement 0 use 9 & to increment 9 use 0. Consider the 0th digit as even.

Example:
Input: 37290
<<Index:[01234]>>
Output: 28109 

ClassName: CheckNumber
Problem:
Check whether a given number is kaprekar number or not?

Kaprekar number:
Number whose square when divided into two parts and such that sum of parts is equal to the original number and none of the parts has value 0.

Example:
Input: 45
Output: true

Explanation:
Square of given number (45 * 45 = 2025)
dividing square into two parts (20, 25)
check sum of divided value is equal to given number i.e (20 + 25 = 45)

Problem:
Check whether a given number is Armstrong number or not?

Armstrong number:
